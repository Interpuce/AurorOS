# AurorOS

Our lightweight, custom OS made without any existing kernel - directly from Interpuce!

> [!WARNING]
> Filesystem is a bit broken. If the FS compiles it may not work at some situations. You may have to change SATA drive handling mode (BIOS/UEFI setting) in order to make everything work (`configure SATA as [AHCI] [IDE]`). AHCI or IDE should work, but `configure SATA as [RAID]` will probably lead to unexpected behavior. Any filesystem-related actions are **not** stable and **not** ready for production purposes.
